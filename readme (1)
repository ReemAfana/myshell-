=============================

myshell:
---------------
myshell is a simple command-line shell program written in C. It mimics basic functionality of popular UNIX shells. You can use it to navigate directories, run programs, redirect input/output, execute commands in the background, and read command sequences from a batch file.

How to Run:
--------------
To start myshell in interactive mode:

    ./myshell

To run a batch file (a file with a list of commands):

    ./myshell batchfile.txt

Built-in Commands:
---------------------
- cd [directory]
    Change the current working directory. If no directory is given, prints the current one.

- clr
    Clears the screen.

- dir [directory]
    Lists contents of the given directory. Defaults to current directory if none is specified.

- environ
    Lists all environment variables.

- echo [text]
    Prints the given text.

- help

- pause
    Pauses execution until the user presses Enter.

- quit
    Exits the shell.

Features:
------------
Input/Output Redirection:
    - < to read input from a file:        command < input.txt
    - > to write output (overwrite):      command > output.txt
    - >> to append output to a file:      command >> output.txt

Background Execution:
    - Add & to the end of a command to run it in the background.

Batch File Mode:
    - Create a file with commands (e.g., commands.txt)
    - Run it like this:
        ./myshell commands.txt

Environment Variables:
    - shell is set to the full path of myshell
    - parent is passed to all external programs as an environment variable

Notes:
---------
- All redirection symbols (<, >, >>, &) must be space-separated.
- The current working directory is shown in the shell prompt.
- Error messages are shown if commands fail or files are not found.

My shell Structure:

- myshell.c        → Main shell logic and input loop
- utility.c        → Functions for built-in and external command handling
- myshell.h        → Shared constants and function declarations
- makefile         → Compiles myshell using gcc
- readme           → This help manual
